Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to complete the remaining tasks for your S3 bucket project:

### 2. Implement S3 Storage Classes

**a. Classify the Uploaded Content:**
1. **Go to the AWS Management Console** and open the S3 service.
2. **Select the bucket** you created (techvista-portfolio-[your-initials]).
3. **Navigate to the "Objects" tab** and select the files you want to classify.
4. **Click on "Actions"** and then "Change storage class."
5. **Choose the appropriate storage class** for each type of content:
   - **Standard:** For frequently accessed files like HTML and CSS files.
   - **Intelligent-Tiering:** For files where access patterns are unknown.
   - **Glacier:** For archival purposes, such as older images that are infrequently accessed.

**b. Justify Your Choice:**
- **HTML/CSS Files:** Use **Standard** because they are accessed frequently.
- **Images:** If they are used often, use **Standard**; otherwise, consider **Glacier** for older images.

### 3. Lifecycle Management

**a. Create a Lifecycle Policy:**
1. **Open the S3 Management Console** and select your bucket.
2. Go to the **"Management" tab** and click on **"Lifecycle"**.
3. Click **"Add lifecycle rule"** and enter a name for the rule (e.g., "Transition and Expire").
4. **Define the scope** of the rule (e.g., Apply to all objects or specific prefixes).
5. **Add transition actions**:
   - Click **"Add transition"**.
   - Choose to transition objects to **Glacier** (or another storage class) after a certain number of days.
6. **Add expiration actions**:
   - Click **"Add expiration"**.
   - Set it to delete non-current versions of objects after **90 days**.

**b. Verify Lifecycle Rules:**
1. **Review the rule configuration** in the S3 console under the Lifecycle section.
2. **Wait for the policy to be applied** or manually check for objects that meet the criteria.

### 4. Configure Bucket Policies and ACLs

**a. Create and Attach a Bucket Policy:**
1. Go to the **"Permissions" tab** of your bucket.
2. Click on **"Bucket Policy"**.
3. **Add a policy** to allow public read access:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::techvista-portfolio-[your-initials]/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
4. **Save the bucket policy**.

**b. Restrict S3 Management Console Access:**
1. **Open IAM Management Console** and find the relevant IAM user or group.
2. **Attach a policy** that restricts access to the S3 Management Console but allows necessary permissions.

**c. Set Up ACL for External User:**
1. **Select the bucket** and go to the **"Permissions" tab**.
2. Click on **"Access Control List (ACL)"**.
3. **Add a grant** for a specific user:
   - Click on **"Add more permissions"**.
   - Enter the external user's email or AWS account ID.
   - Set the permissions to allow access to a specific folder or object.

### 5. Test and Validate the Configuration

**a. Test Static Website URL:**
1. Go to the **"Properties" tab** of your bucket.
2. Find the **"Static website hosting"** section and copy the **Endpoint URL**.
3. Open the URL in a web browser to ensure the static website is accessible.

**b. Validate Storage Class Transitions:**
1. **Check objects in your bucket** after some time to see if they have transitioned to the specified storage class.
2. Go to the **"Management" tab** and review the storage class of your objects.

**c. Check Bucket Policies and ACLs:**
1. **Simulate Access Scenarios**:
   - Try accessing the website URL as an anonymous user.
   - Verify if restricted IAM users can access or manage the S3 resources.
   - Ensure that specific external users can access the designated folder as per the ACL.

By following these steps, youâ€™ll have effectively configured and validated your S3 bucket to meet all project requirements.
